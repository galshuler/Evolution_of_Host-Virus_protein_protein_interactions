# Evolution of Host-Virus protein-protein interactions
<p align="justify">

The interactions between host and viral proteins can determine the outcome of viral infection as well as virus ability to transfer to new host species, but the forces that shape the evolution of the host-virus interactome are not well understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of host-virus domain-motif interactions, where viruses mimic host-like peptide motifs to interact with host domains and subvert important host machineries.
